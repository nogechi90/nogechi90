### My Projects

### Project 1: Hospital Patients and Data Cleaning Analysis

### Tools Used: SQL, Tableau

**Description:** This project analyzes hospital patients records from Massachusetts General Hospital, covering the years 2011 to 2022 to discover patient demographics, insurance coverage, and medical encounters & procedures.

**Key Analyses:** 
- **Patient Admissions Over the Years**: Examining trends in patient admissions over time.
- **Procedure Coverage**: Evaluating the number of procedures covered by insurance.
- **Median Visit Cost**: Calculating the median cost per visit.
- **Hospital Stay Duration**: Measuring the average duration of inpatient stays.

-**Additional Analyses:** 
- Insurance payouts
- Common procedures
- Procedure durations 
- Patient demographics 
- Cost analysis

**Summary**: 
The analysis revealed an increase in patient admissions over the past decade, with significant variability in procedure coverage by insurance. The median visit cost has remained relatively stable, but there are opportunities to reduce costs by optimizing hospital stay durations. -

**Recommendations**: 

**Improve Insurance Coverage**: Work with insurance companies to cover more procedures and reduce patient out-of-pocket costs. 
**Optimize Patient Stay**: Implement strategies to reduce the average length of hospital stays without compromising care quality.
